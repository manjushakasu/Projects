 AddingArray.java  : In two sorted arrays of integers, this program 
                     finds the pair of indices (one into each array)Â  
                     which identify elements which sum to a given integer,
                     if any such pair exists.
 
 Sub_Sequence.java : It gives the largest monotonically contagious 
                     subsequence in a given sequence and reverses it.
